# Please describe your signals using natural language, at least include mnemonic, unit and decription.
# Format:
# - mnemonic: {mnemonic}:       # This is the short name or code for the signal (e.g. SPP)
#   description: >-             # Describe what this signal is, how it's measured, and what it means.
#     {description}             # Write your description here using natural language.
#   unit: {unit}                # Unit of measurement, e.g. tons, bars, kg.
#   quantity: {quantity}        # (Optional) Physical quantity, e.g. force, pressure, weight.
#
# You can copy and modify this format for each signal you want to describe.
# A concrete example:
# - mnemonic: SPP:
#   description: >-
#     SPP is a stand pipe pressure. It is in bars. It has a known accuracy of approx. +- 5%.
#   unit: bar
#   quantity: pressure

- mnemonic: HKLAVG
  description: >-
    Signal HKLAVG is a hookload. It is measured at the deadline and averaged over a 2s window. It is provided in tons.
  unit: ton

- mnemonic: SPP
  description: >-
    SPP is a stand pipe pressure. It is in bars. It has a known accuracy of approx. +- 5%.
  unit: bar

- mnemonic: SWOB
  description: >-
    SWOB is a surface WOB. It is derived from the signal HKLAVG. The taring is performed manually by the driller. It is in kg.
  unit: kg

- mnemonic: MaxSPP
  description: >-
    MaxSPP is the maximum SPP for FDIR functions. It is a 3 dimensional table, where the axes are top of string velocity, topdrive rpm, flowrate. The values for the axes are stored in the signals MaxSPP_BVEL, MaxSPP_ROT, MaxSPP_FR. The values are expressed in Pa.
  unit: Pa
