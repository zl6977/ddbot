Interpret_mnemonic:
  placeholders: [<user_query>, <complementary_knowledge>]
  default: "v3"
  v3: |-
    Task Objective: Split the provided mnemonic used in the drilling domain into meaningful components, interpret the meaning of each component.
    Do it step by step strictly:
    1. Split the mnemonic by special symbol like '_', '#'.
    2. Consider to split the mnemonic if there is a number suffix. It often means the index of the series data channel, such as 'SPM2' means 'the 2nd SPM data'. But the number can also be part of a name, such as 'C3' can mean 'Propane'.
    3. Split the mnemonic if it includes a combination of a number and a time unit as a suffix. This often represents a data filter, e.g., RPM30s means "the average RPM over 30 seconds".
    4. Split the mnemonic if it includes strings as prefix and keyword from the complementary knowledge.
    5. Consider to split the mnemonic if some parts of the mnemonic can be considered as shorthand for drilling terms. For example, 'THKD' can be splitted into 'T' and 'HKD', as 'HKD' can be a drilling term 'Hookload'.
    6. Interpret the mnemonic component by component using both the unit and the text description, including all components. If a component is not understandable, use 'uncertain'. For example, according to 'Total Hookload, kkgf', 'THKD' can be interpreted as '{T:Total, HKD: Hookload}'. According to 'MudPit Volume Average 9, m3', 'GS_TV09' can be interpreted as '{GS:GeoService, TV: tank volume, 09: index 9}'.
    7. Provide some short remarks, e.g., if the unit is 'm', the physical quantity can be 'Length' or 'Depth'; if the unit is 'm/s', it can be a 'Velocity'.

    Input:
    ```
    User query:
    <user_query>
    Complementary knowledge:
    <complementary_knowledge>
    ```

    Output:
      Return the result in the format: {"mnemonic component 1": meaning, "mnemonic component 2": meaning, ..., Remark: Remarks}, without any explanation or additional information. For example, 'THKD' can be interpreted as '{T:Total, HKD: Hookload, Remark:ForceQuantity}'.

Preselect_quantity:
  placeholders: [<user_query>, <interpretation>, <complementary_knowledge>, <selection_range>]
  default: "v2"
  v2: |-
    Task Objective: Based on mnemonic-based metadata in user query used in the drilling domain, preselect the relevant quantities from a provided candidate list. Do it step by step strictly:
    1. Unit Matching (Find relevant and strong matches):
      For each candidate in the candidate list, compare the candidate's QuantityHasUnit with the Unit from the user query.
      If the 2 units are semantically similar, include the candidate in a relevant list.
      Note that the 2 units from the candidate and user query do not have to be identical, as long as they are semantically similar. For example, "m/s" and "meterPerSecond" are semantically similar.
      If the user query's unit does not explicitly appear in any candidate but you understand it and reasonably believe it applies to a candidate, still include that candidate.
      If a candidate aligns with `Interpretation`, include it in the relevant list and mark it as a strong match.
    2. Semantic Exclusion:
      If only <num_quantity_candidates> or fewer candidates are in the relevant list, skip this step and retain all.
      If more than <num_quantity_candidates> candidates are in the relevant list:
      - Use the Description, Interpretation, and Complementary knowledge, along with your own drilling knowledge, to exclude clearly irrelevant candidates from the relevant list.
      - Note that the user's interpretation is trustworthy if it exists, while the LLM's interpretation could be helpful but not guaranteed. If the quantity in the LLM's interpretation can not be found in candidate list, ignore the interpretation.
      - If uncertain about a candidate, keep it.
    3. Select up to <num_quantity_candidates> matches from the relevant list based on relevance, and especially ensure the best match and strong matches are included.
      - Use "UncertainQuantity" if it seems that the amount of information provided is not enough to select a quantity.
      - Use "OutOfSetQuantity" if you could generally see what the quantity is, but it is not in the candidate list.
    4. Name recheck (Priority 0): Ensure the selected candidates are from the provided candidate list, using the exact name as given.

    Input:

    Output:
      Up to <num_quantity_candidates> selected quantities, strictly formatted as `item1,item2,...,item<num_quantity_candidates>`, or "UncertainQuantity" as placeholder, without any explanation or additional information.
      The most probable candidate should be placed in the first position.

      If they are semantically similar or explained explicitly in `complementary knowledge`, include it in a relevant list and mark it as a strong match.
      If a candidate is potentially relevant, for example, for the same physical quantity as the user query, also include it in the relevant list.
